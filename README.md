# URL Shortener Microservice

This project is my solution for [APIs and Microservices Projects - URL Shortener Microservice] and it's a part of APIs and Microservices Certification by [freeCodeCamp].

## Requirements

- [x] You can POST a URL to `/api/shorturl/new` and get a JSON response with original_url and short_url properties. 

- [x] When you visit `/api/shorturl/<short_url>`, you will be redirected to the original URL.

- [x] If you pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid `http://www.example.com` format, the JSON response will contain `{ error: 'invalid url' }`
